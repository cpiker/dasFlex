This directory contains versions of the pycdf module from the SpacePy project.
Minimal modules without the rest of SpacePy are included to help make the 
"Params" example data source work.

These were included due to an incompatiblity between SpacePy and libcdf.so 
introduced when the official CDF distribution removed functions used by
spacepy.pycdf.  If for some reason you are having trouble getting the cdf.py
reader to run use the following proceedure to symlink one of the modules into
your das2-pyserver library area as a work-around.


1) Find out which version of libcdf.so is installed on your system

   find /usr/local -name "libcdf.so.*"
   find /usr/lib -name "libcdf.so.*"

   You should find either libcdf.so.3.7.0 or libcdf.so.3.7.1

2) Symlink ONE of the following items depending on the version of CDF
   in use.  The 3.7.0 and 3.7.1 libraries are incompatable! :

   ln -s $(pwd)/libcdf3.7.0  DAS2SRV_INSTALL/lib/pythonX.X/pycdf

     --or--

   ln -s $(pwd)/libcdf3.7.0  DAS2SRV_INSTALL/lib/pythonX.X/pycdf
	
	Where $(pwd) is the directory containing this file (fallback_pycdf.txt)
	and DAS2SRV_INSTALL is the directory containing your das2-pyserver
	installation.  (most likely /usr/local/das2srv).

Then load the "Params" data source again and see if it works.  Best of luck!
