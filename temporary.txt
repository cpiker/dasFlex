Data sources advertised in das2-pyserver catalog listings can be merged into
the federated das2 catalog system.  Export a site identifier for your server.
The site ID should be lower case, it should not start with a number and may 
only contain ASCII 7-bit alphabetic and underscores.  Examples are given below:

```
$ export DAS2_SITE=uiowa     # University of Iowa
$ export DAS2_SITE=iap_cap   # Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Czech Acadame of Sciences
```

This is only a database token, the actual description associated with the
token is sent in the federated catalog pages.  Select any short mnemonic
that makes sense for your organization, so long as it does not conflict
with existing entries in 
this [catalog](https://das2.org/catalog/das/site.json).
